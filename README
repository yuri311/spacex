*** Architecture ***
A single activity contains 2 different fragment, I used a view model pattern to share data across them.
3 LiveData objects are used to load the UI on API call completion. Didn't spend time trying to merge
the results of the 2 API calls (rocket details and launch details) and have a single LiveData source,
although it would be a cleaner solution
I Used built-in Kotlin list methods to order. Didn't manage to finish grouping
